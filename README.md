# Bjorklund/Euclidean Rhythms
A simple ruby program for computing evenly spaced rhythm sequences based on bjoklund/euclidean algorithms.

For more information see [Godfried Toussaint's paper](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf) on the subject.

## Execution

For example if k=3 and n=15 run:
```
>ruby e.rb 3 15
E(5,13)=[x..x.x..x.x..]
```

To run the built-in test cases:
```
>ruby tests.rb
```
